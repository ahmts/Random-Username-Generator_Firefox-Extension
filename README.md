## How to try?

### Firefox

1. Download the `.zip` file to your device from the `Releases` section.
2. In the search bar of your browser, make a search in the form of [`about:debuging#/runtime/this-firefox`](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) .(Thus, Firefox's debug page must have been opened.)
3. Select the `Load Temporary Add-On...` button `.zip` extension file you have downloaded.

You can experience the plug -in as long as you no longer close Firefox.
(Because it is run in debug mode.)
